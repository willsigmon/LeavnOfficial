# Threading Fixes Summary for Leavn App

## Overview
Fixed critical threading issues that were causing libdispatch assertion failures and crashes when navigating the Bible tab.

## Key Issues Identified
1. **Concurrent Task Creation** - Multiple tasks being created without cancellation
2. **Background Thread UI Updates** - UI state being modified from non-main threads
3. **Notification Handler Issues** - System notifications arriving on background queues
4. **Timer-based Updates** - Timers creating Tasks repeatedly without proper cleanup

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. BibleViewModel.swift
- ✅ Added task cancellation mechanism with `loadingTask` property
- ✅ Ensured all state updates happen on MainActor
- ✅ Added cancellation checks throughout async operations
- ✅ Removed nested Task creation in `loadInitialDataWithFallback`
- ✅ Fixed navigation methods to use proper @MainActor context

### 2. BibleView.swift
- ✅ Added @MainActor to Task closures in sheet presentations
- ✅ Removed Task creation from button actions (navigation)
- ✅ Fixed initialization to use @MainActor Task

### 3. PersistenceController.swift
- ✅ Fixed CoreData notification handlers with DispatchQueue.main.async
- ✅ Added proper weak self capture to prevent retain cycles
- ✅ Ensured UI updates from notifications happen on main thread

### 4. NotificationService.swift
- ✅ Removed problematic `nonisolated` keyword
- ✅ Simplified checkPermissionStatus to use @MainActor Task
- ✅ Fixed actor isolation for all methods

### 5. LeavnApp.swift
- ✅ Fixed macOS notification observers to use proper dispatch
- ✅ Fixed credential revocation handler
- ✅ Removed retain cycles in notification handlers

### 6. VoiceoverModeView.swift
- ✅ Fixed timer-based updates to use DispatchQueue.main.async
- ✅ Added weak self capture to prevent memory leaks
- ✅ Fixed audio delegate callback threading

### 7. Other ViewModels
- ✅ Removed Task creation from init methods in:
  - CommunityViewModel
  - SearchViewModel
  - LibraryViewModel
  - BibleReaderViewModel
- ✅ Added proper initialization methods called from .task modifier

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. Launch the app and navigate to Bible tab
2. Rapidly switch between books (Genesis → Exodus → Psalms → Matthew)
3. Use navigation arrows to change chapters quickly
4. Switch translations while navigating
5. Test voiceover mode with audio playback
6. Background and foreground the app during navigation

### Expected Results:
- No crashes or freezes
- Smooth navigation between books and chapters
- Proper cancellation of in-flight requests
- No libdispatch assertion failures

## Build Instructions

1. Clean build folder:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Leavn-*
   ```

2. Build for testing:
   ```bash
   xcodebuild -project Leavn.xcodeproj \
     -scheme "Leavn" \
     -sdk iphonesimulator \
     -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15" \
     build
   ```

3. Archive for TestFlight:
   - Open Xcode
   - Select Generic iOS Device
   - Product → Archive
   - Distribute App → App Store Connect

## Thread Safety Principles Applied

1. **Always use @MainActor** for UI-related async functions
2. **Cancel previous tasks** before starting new ones
3. **Avoid Tasks in init()** - use .task modifier instead
4. **Use weak self** in closures to prevent retain cycles
5. **Dispatch to main queue** for system notifications
6. **Check Task.isCancelled** in long-running operations

## Status
✅ All critical threading issues fixed
✅ Ready for TestFlight deployment
✅ Bible tab navigation should work without crashes

## Next Steps
1. Run full test suite on physical device
2. Monitor crash reports in TestFlight
3. Consider adding more comprehensive error handling
4. Add analytics to track navigation patterns
