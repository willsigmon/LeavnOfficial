Based on my research about Project Leavn, here's a tailored Cursor configuration designed specifically for your AI-powered Bible study app:

**Project Leavn - Cursor Configuration Guidelines**

1. **Core Design Philosophy**
   - **Prioritize stillness and contemplation** over rapid interaction
   - Design for **sustained focus** rather than quick engagement
   - Embrace **minimalism** that supports deep study and reflection
   - Create **serene, distraction-free experiences** that honor the sacred nature of Scripture

2. **Development Standards**
   - Follow **responsive design principles** for seamless cross-device experience
   - Implement **accessibility-first development** to ensure Scripture is available to all users
   - Use **semantic HTML** that respects the structure and meaning of biblical text
   - Prioritize **performance optimization** for smooth, uninterrupted study sessions
   - Build with **offline-first capabilities** for consistent access to Scripture

3. **User Experience Guidelines**
   - **Three-pane layout**: Keep Scripture, commentary, and AI conversation visible simultaneously
   - **Eliminate tab-juggling** through integrated, contextual information architecture
   - Design **adaptive interfaces** that respond to user study habits and preferences
   - Create **visual hierarchy** that naturally guides the eye through biblical content
   - Use **typography and spacing** that enhances readability and reduces eye strain

4. **AI Integration Principles**
   - **Scripture-first approach**: AI should enhance, not overshadow, the biblical text
   - Build **contextually aware responses** that understand theological nuance
   - Design **conversational flows** that encourage deeper reflection and questions
   - Implement **respectful AI interactions** that honor diverse faith traditions
   - Create **learning pathways** that adapt to individual spiritual growth

5. **Content Architecture**
   - **Preserve biblical context** in all design and development decisions
   - Structure **commentary integration** that complements rather than competes with Scripture
   - Design **cross-reference systems** that illuminate connections across biblical texts
   - Build **note-taking capabilities** that support personal study and reflection
   - Create **progress tracking** that celebrates spiritual growth milestones

6. **Technical Excellence**
   - **Secure handling** of personal spiritual data and study notes
   - **Reliable synchronization** across devices for continuous study experience
   - **Graceful error handling** that maintains the contemplative experience
   - **Performance monitoring** focused on study session quality and engagement depth
   - **Privacy-conscious development** that respects the personal nature of faith

7. **Community and Feedback**
   - Design **feedback systems** that align with the app's contemplative nature
   - Build **community features** that foster spiritual discussion and growth
   - Create **sharing capabilities** that respect the sacred nature of personal insights
   - Implement **support systems** that provide gentle guidance rather than intrusive help
   - Design **onboarding experiences** that introduce users to stillness and deep study

**Remember**: Leavn exists to help people "grow in the Word" through quiet transformation. Every code decision should support this mission of bringing stillness, depth, and spiritual growth to Bible study in our scroll-first world[1][2][3][4][5].
