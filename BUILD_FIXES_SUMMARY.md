# Build Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ DependencyContainer Import Issues
**Problem**: `Cannot find 'DependencyContainer' in scope` in LeavnApp.swift
**Solution**: 
- Temporarily commented out the new DependencyContainer usage
- Reverted to using existing DIContainer until proper module structure is set up
- The new architecture files need to be properly integrated into the module system

### 2. ✅ Container View Import Issues  
**Problem**: `Cannot find 'SearchContainerView' and 'LibraryContainerView' in scope`
**Solution**:
- Reverted MainTabView to use the existing SearchView and LibraryView
- Container views will be integrated when module structure is properly configured

### 3. ✅ MainActor Isolation Warning
**Problem**: `Call to main actor-isolated instance method 'pauseDuration(for:)' in a synchronous nonisolated context`
**Solution**:
- Added `nonisolated` keyword to the `pauseDuration` method in ElevenLabsAudioService
- This allows the method to be called from the nonisolated `generateSSML` method

### 4. ✅ NVME Build Path Issues
**Problem**: Build artifacts referencing non-existent NVME volume paths
**Solution**:
- Cleaned Xcode build folder using `xcodebuild clean`
- Removed DerivedData for the project
- Deleted any remaining NVME references

## Next Steps

To fully integrate the new MVVM-C architecture:

1. **Module Integration**
   - Add the Features/ directory files to appropriate modules or targets
   - Ensure proper module dependencies are configured
   - Update Package.swift or project.pbxproj as needed

2. **Gradual Migration**
   - Keep using existing views/viewmodels in production
   - Integrate new architecture components incrementally
   - Test thoroughly at each integration step

3. **Build Configuration**
   - Ensure build settings don't reference external volumes
   - Use relative paths for all build outputs
   - Configure proper module boundaries

## Current State

- ✅ App builds successfully
- ✅ No compiler errors
- ✅ MainActor warnings resolved
- ✅ Clean build environment

The new architecture files are ready but need proper module integration before they can be used in the main app target.
