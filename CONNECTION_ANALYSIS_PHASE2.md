# Phase 2: Connection Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the codebase, I've identified critical disconnections between components that prevent the app from using real data. The app has properly structured services and models, but ViewModels are not connected to services, and there's no proper dependency injection system in place.

## 1. ViewModel-Service Disconnections

### BibleViewModel Issues
- **Location**: `/Modules/Bible/ViewModels/BibleViewModel.swift`
- **Problem**: Completely disconnected from any Bible service
- **Current State**:
  - Hardcoded book list: `["Genesis", "Exodus", "Leviticus", "Numbers", "Deuteronomy"]`
  - Mock loading with 0.5s delay
  - No service injection or usage
  - No real Bible data fetching

### BibleReaderViewModel Issues
- **Location**: `/Modules/Bible/ViewModels/BibleReaderViewModel.swift`
- **Problem**: Returns mock data instead of real content
- **Current State**:
  - Returns `"Chapter X content"` for any chapter
  - No connection to Bible service
  - No verse data structure

### Missing Service Connections
1. **LibraryViewModel** - No connection to persistence service
2. **SearchViewModel** - No connection to search service
3. **CommunityViewModel** - No connection to community service
4. **SettingsViewModel** - No connection to settings persistence

## 2. Dependency Injection Breakdown

### DIContainer Status
- **Production Container**: Located at `/Core/LeavnCore/Sources/LeavnServices/DIContainer.swift`
- **Issues**:
  - Factory dependency removed (commented out)
  - Most services return mocks or fatal errors
  - No proper initialization in app startup
  - Container not provided to views via environment

### Service Registration Problems
```swift
// Current state - returns mocks or crashes
public func bibleService() -> BibleServiceProtocol {
    #if DEBUG
    let cacheManager = InMemoryBibleCacheManager()
    #else
    fatalError("CoreDataBibleCacheManager is not available.")
    #endif
    // Service created but never used by ViewModels
}
```

## 3. View-ViewModel Connection Issues

### HomeView
- **Uses**: `@EnvironmentObject private var container: DIContainer`
- **Problem**: DIContainer not provided in environment
- **Impact**: Crashes or falls back to mock data

### BibleView
- **Uses**: `@StateObject private var viewModel = BibleViewModel()`
- **Problem**: Creates ViewModel without service injection
- **Impact**: Always shows mock data

### Missing Data Flow
1. Views create ViewModels without dependencies
2. ViewModels don't receive services
3. No observable data updates from services
4. User actions don't trigger real service calls

## 4. Data Persistence Analysis

### What Should Be Saved (But Isn't)
1. **User Preferences**:
   - Selected Bible translation
   - Reading position
   - Font size preferences
   - Theme settings

2. **Library Data**:
   - Saved verses
   - Notes
   - Highlights
   - Collections

3. **Progress Data**:
   - Reading streak
   - Verses read
   - Time spent reading

### Current Persistence
- **UserDefaults**: Used for basic app storage in HomeView
  - `@AppStorage("readingStreak")`
  - `@AppStorage("lastReadDate")`
  - `@AppStorage("totalVersesRead")`
- **Core Data**: Configured but not connected
- **Keychain**: Available but unused

## 5. Specific Broken Flows

### Bible Reading Flow
1. User opens Bible tab â†’ BibleView loads
2. BibleViewModel created without service
3. Shows hardcoded books only
4. Chapter selection does nothing
5. No actual Bible content displayed

### Search Flow
1. User enters search query
2. SearchViewModel has no service connection
3. No results returned
4. UI shows empty state

### Library Flow
1. User tries to save verse
2. No service to handle save
3. Data lost on app restart
4. No sync capability

## 6. Service Implementation Status

### Working Services
- **BibleService** (`DefaultBibleService`): Fully implemented with ESV API
- **NetworkService**: Basic implementation exists
- **Configuration**: Structure in place

### Missing/Broken Services
- **AuthenticationService**: Returns mock
- **LibraryRepository**: Returns mock
- **SearchService**: Not implemented
- **CloudSyncService**: Not implemented

## 7. Root Causes

1. **No DI System**: Factory dependency removed, no replacement
2. **No App Initialization**: Services not created at startup
3. **No Environment Setup**: Container not injected into SwiftUI environment
4. **ViewModel Isolation**: ViewModels created without dependencies
5. **Service Stubs**: Real services exist but aren't connected

## 8. Critical Path to Fix

1. **Implement Simple DI Container**:
   - Create singleton container
   - Register all services
   - Provide via SwiftUI environment

2. **Update ViewModels**:
   - Add service dependencies
   - Connect to real services
   - Implement proper data fetching

3. **Wire Up App Startup**:
   - Initialize container in App
   - Configure services
   - Inject into environment

4. **Connect Data Flow**:
   - ViewModels observe services
   - Services update published properties
   - Views react to changes

## Next Steps

The app has all the pieces but they're not connected. We need to:
1. Create a working DI container
2. Update ViewModels to use services
3. Wire everything up at app startup
4. Test each flow end-to-end

This will transform the app from showing mock data to being a fully functional Bible app with real content, search, and persistence.
