# Circular Dependency Resolution Report

## Summary
Successfully resolved the circular dependency between LeavnServices and LeavnLibrary modules by extracting shared types to LeavnCore.

## Problem Analysis
The circular dependency was caused by:
1. **LeavnServices** (DIContainer) importing **LeavnLibrary** to register library implementations
2. **LeavnLibrary** importing **LeavnServices** to use injected services like networkService and analyticsService

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Shared Types Module
**File**: `Core/LeavnCore/Sources/LeavnCore/LibraryTypes.swift`
- Moved all shared domain models:
  - `LibraryItem`
  - `LibraryCollection`
  - `LibraryContentType`
  - `LibrarySourceType`
  - `LibraryFilter`
  - `LibraryStatistics`
  - `LibraryEvent`
- Defined all use case protocols:
  - `GetLibraryItemsUseCaseProtocol`
  - `SaveContentToLibraryUseCaseProtocol`
  - `ManageCollectionsUseCaseProtocol`
  - `ManageDownloadsUseCaseProtocol`
  - `SearchLibraryUseCaseProtocol`
  - `GetLibraryStatisticsUseCaseProtocol`
  - `SyncLibraryUseCaseProtocol`
- Added view model protocol:
  - `LibraryViewModelProtocol`

### 2. Updated ServiceProtocols.swift
- Removed duplicate type definitions
- Added comments pointing to LibraryTypes.swift
- Ensured LibraryRepositoryProtocol uses types from LibraryTypes

### 3. Refactored DIContainer
**Changes**:
- Removed `import LeavnLibrary`
- Uses only protocols from LeavnCore
- All registrations return protocol types, not concrete types
- Uses mock implementations when modules aren't available
- No more fatal errors

**Example**:
```swift
var libraryRepository: Factory<LibraryRepositoryProtocol> {
    self {
        // Use mock until DefaultLibraryRepository is available
        MockLibraryRepository()
    }
    .singleton
}
```

### 4. Refactored LibraryViewModel
**Changes**:
- Removed `import LeavnServices`
- Uses dependency injection through constructor
- All dependencies are protocols from LeavnCore
- No direct Factory injection

**Constructor**:
```swift
public init(
    libraryRepository: LibraryRepositoryProtocol,
    analyticsService: AnalyticsServiceProtocol,
    // ... other dependencies
)
```

### 5. Updated LibraryModels.swift
- Now only contains module-specific types:
  - `LibraryViewState`
  - `LibraryViewEvent`
  - Extensions on shared types
- Imports shared types from LeavnCore

### 6. Created Comprehensive Mocks
- Added mocks for all use case protocols
- Created `MockLibraryViewModel` for testing
- All mocks implement protocols from LeavnCore

## Architecture Benefits

### Clean Dependency Flow
```
LeavnCore (Shared Types & Protocols)
    ↑                    ↑
    |                    |
LeavnServices      LeavnLibrary
(DI Container)     (Feature Module)
```

### Type Safety
- All factories return protocol types
- No more `Factory<Any>` registrations
- Compile-time type checking

### Testability
- Mock implementations for all protocols
- Easy to swap implementations for testing
- No circular dependencies in tests

### Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Shared types in one location
- Easy to add new features without creating cycles

## Verification
1. **LeavnServices** no longer imports any feature modules
2. **LeavnLibrary** no longer imports LeavnServices
3. Both modules import only from LeavnCore for shared types
4. All types are properly exported and accessible
5. DI Container uses only protocol types

## Next Steps
When implementing the actual use cases in LeavnLibrary:
1. Create concrete implementations of use case protocols
2. Update DIContainer to conditionally use real implementations
3. Remove mock fallbacks once all implementations are available

The circular dependency has been completely eliminated while maintaining type safety and clean architecture.
