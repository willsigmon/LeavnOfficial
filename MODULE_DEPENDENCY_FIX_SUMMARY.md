# Module Dependency Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Circular Dependencies
- **Problem**: Modules within the `LeavnCore` package were importing `LeavnCore` itself
- **Solution**: Removed circular imports from:
  - NetworkingKit (removed `import LeavnCore`)
  - PersistenceKit (removed `import LeavnCore`)
  - AnalyticsKit (removed `import LeavnCore`)
  - DesignSystem (removed `import LeavnCore`)
  - LeavnServices (removed internal package imports)

### 2. Duplicate Type Definitions
- **Problem**: Types were defined in multiple places causing ambiguity
- **Fixed**:
  - Removed duplicate `LeavnConfiguration` from Configuration.swift (kept only in LeavnCore.swift)
  - Removed duplicate `User` struct from ServiceProtocols.swift
  - Removed duplicate `DateRange` struct from ServiceProtocols.swift
  - Added `features` property to LeavnConfiguration

### 3. Missing Type Definitions
- **Problem**: ServiceProtocols.swift referenced types that weren't defined
- **Added**:
  - `AppSettings` struct with theme and font settings
  - `Theme` and `FontSize` enums
  - `SettingsChangeEvent` struct
  - `SettingsBackup` struct
  - `LifeSituation` struct

### 4. Invalid Module Imports
- **Problem**: HapticManager was importing non-existent `LeavnSettings` module
- **Solution**: Removed the invalid import

## Package Structure

The `LeavnCore` package contains these modules:
- **LeavnCore**: Core types, protocols, and utilities
- **NetworkingKit**: Network service implementation
- **PersistenceKit**: Storage and caching
- **AnalyticsKit**: Analytics tracking
- **DesignSystem**: UI components and themes
- **LeavnServices**: Service implementations

Since they're all part of the same package, they don't need to import each other explicitly. Types defined in `LeavnCore` are available to all other modules in the package.

## Next Steps

1. Clean build folder in Xcode: `Cmd+Shift+K`
2. Resolve packages: `File > Packages > Resolve Package Versions`
3. Build the project: `Cmd+B`

The circular dependencies and type conflicts should now be resolved.
