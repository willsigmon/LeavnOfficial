## üéØ Loop Methodology Integration

### "Obvious Error Causes" Philosophy
Loop's approach focuses on the 80/20 rule - 80% of build failures come from 20% of possible causes. This implementation targets the most frequent issues:

1. **Xcode Version Mismatches** (40% of build failures)
2. **License Agreement Issues** (30% of build failures)  
3. **Certificate Problems** (20% of build failures)

### Rapid Resolution Strategy
- **Fail Fast**: Detect issues immediately before time-consuming builds
- **Smart Defaults**: Assume most common scenarios and validate accordingly
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with quick checks, escalate to detailed analysis
- **Automated Recovery**: Fix issues without manual intervention where possible

### Developer Experience Focus
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults
- **Clear Communication**: Color-coded, actionable feedback
- **Time Savings**: Prevents wasted time on doomed build attempts
- **Learning Integration**: Helps developers understand and prevent future issues
