## 3. Dependency Path Verification

### In Modules/Package.swift
- Dependency path: `../Packages/LeavnCore`
- Resolved path: `/Users/wsig/Cursor Repos/LeavnOfficial/Packages/LeavnCore`
- ✅ **Valid** - Path exists and contains Package.swift

## 4. Project.yml Path Consistency

### Package Paths in project.yml
- LeavnCore: `Packages/LeavnCore` ✅ Matches actual location
- LeavnModules: `Modules` ✅ Matches actual location

### Product Dependencies in project.yml
All product dependencies match the products declared in the respective Package.swift files:
- ✅ LeavnCore products: LeavnCore, DesignSystem, LeavnServices
- ✅ LeavnModules products: LeavnBible, LeavnSearch, LeavnLibrary, LeavnSettings, AuthenticationModule, LeavnOnboarding

## 5. Identified Issues

### No Critical Issues Found
- All Package.swift files are syntactically valid
- All referenced paths exist in the file system
- project.yml paths are consistent with the actual directory structure
- Dependencies between packages are properly configured

### Minor Observations
1. There are some excluded files in the targets (e.g., `*_original.swift`, `*_Improved.swift`), but these exclusions are valid
2. Some disabled Package.swift files exist (e.g., `Discover/Package.swift.disabled`) but don't affect the build

## 6. Summary

✅ **All checks passed successfully**
- Both Package.swift files are syntactically valid
- All paths referenced in Package.swift files exist
- project.yml paths are consistent with the directory structure
- No discrepancies found between declared and actual paths
