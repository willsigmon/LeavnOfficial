# Leavn Project QA Fortress Report

## Build Status
- **Clean Build**: Attempted with failures (25 failures)
- **Derived Data Path**: `/Volumes/NVME/XcodeFiles/LeavnDD` (External NVME drive)
- **Xcode Version**: 26.0 (Build 17A5276g)
- **Target**: iOS Simulator - iPhone 16 Pro, OS 18.5

## Build Issues Detected
1. The build process completed with 25 failures
2. Build artifacts are being written to external NVME drive
3. No lstat phantom errors were detected in the accessible logs
4. Build logs are stored in compressed format at `/Volumes/NVME/XcodeFiles/LeavnDD/Logs/Build/`

## SwiftLint Analysis
- **Total Violations**: 4,296
- **Serious Violations**: 4,296
- **Files Analyzed**: 118

### Top Issues:
1. Trailing whitespace violations (most common)
2. Force cast violations
3. Line length violations
4. Force unwrapping issues
5. Missing file headers
6. Type contents ordering problems
7. Missing explicit top-level access control
8. Weak IBOutlet declarations

## Project Structure
- Main project: `/Users/wsig/GitHub Builds/LeavnOfficial/`
- Local packages: `LeavnCore` and `LeavnModules`
- Multi-platform support detected (iOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS)
- Uses Swift Package Manager for dependencies

## Recommendations
1. Fix build failures before running tests
2. Address SwiftLint violations systematically
3. Configure `.swiftlint.yml` to fix configuration warnings
4. Ensure external drive permissions are correct for build artifacts
5. Consider running incremental builds to isolate specific failures

## Next Steps
- Tests cannot be run due to build failures
- Cross-platform smoke test requires successful build
- Consider running build with verbose logging to capture specific error details
