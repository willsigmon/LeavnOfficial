# Nuclear SPM Cleanup - Findings Report
**Date**: 2025-01-07
**Status**: Manual cleanup required

## Found Issues

### 1. Problematic GUID Located
âœ… **FOUND**: The problematic GUID `1OJ5W07399N9252HQLWU0QSAFZ3TLA8XH` was found in:
- `/Users/wsig/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Leavn-ayrtfhtrsfdrxefdtqyvohiordhk/Build/Intermediates.noindex/XCBuildData/PIFCache/project/PACKAGE@v12_hash=(null)-json`

### 2. Directories That Need Removal

#### DerivedData (FOUND - Contains problematic files)
- `/Users/wsig/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/`
  - Contains 2 projects: `Leavn-ayrtfhtrsfdrxefdtqyvohiordhk` and `ProPortionPal-cvarafgmdchdfvcpdyiqwdsuozlm`
  - The Leavn project contains the problematic GUID

#### SPM Caches (FOUND)
- `/Users/wsig/Library/Caches/org.swift.swiftpm/` - Contains manifest database files
- `/Users/wsig/Library/org.swift.swiftpm/` - Contains configuration and security directories

#### Project-specific directories (FOUND)
- `/Users/wsig/Cursor Repos/LeavnOfficial/Leavn.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcuserdata/` - Contains user state files

### 3. Not Found
- No `Package.resolved` files in the project
- No `swiftpm` directory in `xcshareddata`
- Additional cache directories appear to be empty or not present

## Manual Cleanup Commands

Since I cannot execute shell commands directly, please run these commands in Terminal:

```bash
# 1. First, make sure Xcode is closed

# 2. Remove DerivedData (this is the most important one!)
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/

# 3. Remove SPM caches
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/org.swift.swiftpm
rm -rf ~/Library/org.swift.swiftpm

# 4. Remove project user data
rm -rf ~/Cursor\ Repos/LeavnOfficial/Leavn.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcuserdata

# 5. Remove any additional caches (if they exist)
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.dt.Xcode
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.dt.Xcode.sourcecontrol
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Products

# 6. Optional: Reset Xcode (only if other steps don't work)
# defaults delete com.apple.dt.Xcode
```

## Verification

After cleanup, verify the GUID is gone:
```bash
# Should return no results
grep -r "1OJ5W07399N9252HQLWU0QSAFZ3TLA8XH" ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/
grep -r "1OJ5W07399N9252HQLWU0QSAFZ3TLA8XH" ~/Library/Caches/
```

## Next Steps After Cleanup

1. Open Xcode
2. Clean Build Folder: `Cmd+Shift+K`
3. Reset Package Caches: `File > Packages > Reset Package Caches`
4. Resolve Package Versions: `File > Packages > Resolve Package Versions`
5. Build the project

## Summary

The problematic GUID was found in the DerivedData directory as suspected. The main cleanup action needed is to remove the DerivedData directory, which will force Xcode to rebuild all cached information with correct package references.
