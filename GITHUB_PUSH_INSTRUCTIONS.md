# GitHub Push Instructions for LeavnOfficial

## Steps to push this project to GitHub:

1. **Initialize Git Repository**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/wsig/LeavnParent/Leavn
   git init
   ```

2. **Create .gitignore file** (already exists if needed)
   ```bash
   echo "*.xcuserstate
   .DS_Store
   .build/
   DerivedData/
   *.xcodeproj/xcuserdata/
   *.xcworkspace/xcuserdata/
   .swiftpm/
   Package.resolved" > .gitignore
   ```

3. **Add all files**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Leavn iOS app with real API integration"
   ```

4. **Create GitHub repository**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `LeavnOfficial`
   - Make it private or public as you prefer
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

5. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/LeavnOfficial.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```
