# Fix for Duplicate GUID Error - Complete Solution

## Problem
The project was trying to use local Swift packages but Xcode was creating duplicate GUID references, preventing builds.

## Solution Applied
1. **Removed all Package.swift files** - Renamed to .disabled
2. **Removed package references from project.pbxproj**
3. **Removed module import statements** from Swift files

## Next Steps - IMPORTANT

You need to add all the source files directly to your Xcode project:

### Step 1: Add LeavnCore Sources
1. In Xcode, right-click on the **Leavn** folder in project navigator
2. Select **"Add Files to 'Leavn'..."**
3. Navigate to `Packages/LeavnCore/Sources`
4. Select ALL three folders:
   - `LeavnCore`
   - `LeavnServices` 
   - `DesignSystem`
5. **IMPORTANT Settings:**
   - ✅ Create groups
   - ✅ Add to targets: **Leavn** (make sure it's checked!)
   - ❌ Copy items if needed (uncheck - we want references)
6. Click **Add**

### Step 2: Add Module Sources
1. Right-click on the **Leavn** folder again
2. Select **"Add Files to 'Leavn'..."**
3. Navigate to the `Modules` folder
4. Select these folders:
   - `Authentication`
   - `Bible`
   - `Community`
   - `Library`
   - `Map`
   - `Onboarding`
   - `Search`
   - `Settings`
5. **IMPORTANT Settings:**
   - ✅ Create groups
   - ✅ Add to targets: **Leavn** (make sure it's checked!)
   - ❌ Copy items if needed (uncheck)
6. Click **Add**

### Step 3: Add Platform Sources (if needed)
1. If MainTabView uses platform-specific views, also add:
   - `Leavn/Platform/macOS`
   - `Leavn/Platform/visionOS`
   - `Leavn/Platform/watchOS`

### Step 4: Clean and Build
1. **Clean Build Folder** (⌘⇧K)
2. **Build** (⌘B)

## What Changed
- All Swift Package Manager references have been removed
- Source files will be compiled directly as part of the main app target
- No more module imports needed (all code is in the same module now)

## If You Get Errors
- **"Cannot find type X in scope"** - Make sure you added ALL folders from step 1 and 2
- **"Use of unresolved identifier"** - Check that files are added to the Leavn target
- **Duplicate symbols** - Make sure you didn't add files twice

## Benefits
- No more Swift Package Manager issues
- Faster builds (no package resolution)
- Simpler project structure
- All code in one module
