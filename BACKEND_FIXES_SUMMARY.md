# Backend Services Audit & Fixes Summary

## 1. Bible Data Source Audit ✅

### Current State:
- **BibleBook Model**: Properly includes all 84 books (39 OT + 27 NT + 18 Apocrypha)
- **Data Structure**: Located in `/local/LeavnCore/Sources/LeavnCore/BibleModels.swift`
- **Testament Enum**: Includes `.apocrypha` case

### Issues Found:
- **API Limitation**: The production services use `bible-api.com` which doesn't support Apocrypha books
- **Offline Data**: `OfflineBibleData.swift` only includes popular verses from canonical books, no Apocrypha

### Fixed:
- ✅ Added Apocrypha verses to OfflineBibleData:
  - Added 6 popular Apocrypha verses (Tobit, Wisdom, Sirach, 1 Maccabees, Judith, Baruch)
  - Added complete Wisdom of Solomon Chapter 3 as a sample chapter
- ⚠️ Note: The online API (bible-api.com) still doesn't support Apocrypha, so only offline access is available

## 2. LifeSituations Engine ✅

### Current State:
- **Location**: `/local/LeavnCore/Sources/LeavnServices/LifeSituationsEngine.swift`
- **Status**: Fully implemented and functional
- **Features**:
  - Emotion detection using NLTagger
  - Biblical guidance mapping for emotional states
  - Verse recommendations based on mood
  - Emotional journey tracking

### Integration:
- Properly registered in DIContainer
- Connected to Bible service for verse retrieval
- Used by Audio service for emotional context

## 3. Audio Services (ElevenLabs) ✅

### Current State:
- **Primary Service**: `ElevenLabsAudioService` with full implementation
- **Fallback Service**: `SystemAudioService` using AVSpeechSynthesizer
- **Features**:
  - Voice style adaptation based on emotional context
  - SSML generation for better prosody
  - Caching for performance
  - Integration with LifeSituationsEngine

### Configuration:
- API key retrieved via `AppConfiguration.APIKeys.elevenLabsKey`
- Falls back to system TTS if no API key is configured

## 4. Library & Search Services ✅

### Library Service:
- **Location**: `/local/LeavnCore/Sources/LeavnServices/ProductionLibraryService.swift`
- **Features**: Bookmarks, notes, highlights, reading plans, reading history
- **Storage**: Uses cache service with persistence

### Search Service:
- **Location**: `/local/LeavnCore/Sources/LeavnServices/ProductionSearchService.swift`
- **Features**: Full-text Bible search with caching
- **Integration**: Connected to Bible service

## 5. Service Protocols & Dependency Injection ✅

### Protocol Status:
- All protocols are `public` and properly accessible
- Located in `/local/LeavnCore/Sources/LeavnCore/ServiceProtocols.swift`
- All conform to `Sendable` for Swift 6 concurrency

### DIContainer:
- **Location**: `/local/LeavnCore/Sources/LeavnServices/DIContainer.swift`
- **Initialization**: Called in `LeavnApp.swift` at app launch
- **Service Registration Order**:
  1. Core services (Cache, Network)
  2. Data services (Bible, User, Library)
  3. Feature services (Search, AI, Sync, LifeSituations, Audio)
  4. Coordinators

## 6. API Configuration ✅

### Secret Management:
- Uses `SecretManager` with three tiers:
  1. Environment variables (development)
  2. Keychain (production)
  3. UserDefaults (testing only)

### Required API Keys:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For AI service
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` - For audio narration

## 7. Service Initialization Flow

```
1. App Launch (LeavnApp.swift)
   ↓
2. DIContainer.shared.initialize()
   ↓
3. Register Dependencies
   ├── Core Services
   ├── Data Services
   └── Feature Services
   ↓
4. Initialize Services (in dependency order)
   ↓
5. App Ready
```

## 8. Remaining Tasks

### High Priority:
1. **Complete Apocrypha Support** (Partially Done)
   - ✅ Added Apocrypha verses to offline data
   - ⚠️ Still needed: Implement alternative Bible API that supports Apocrypha
   - ⚠️ Still needed: Update GetBibleService to handle Apocrypha books from API

### Medium Priority:
2. **Model Consistency** (#7)
   - Verify all models have proper Sendable conformance
   - Add missing Equatable/Identifiable conformances

3. **Protocol Conformances** (#8)
   - Audit all models for missing conformances
   - Add Sendable to remaining types

### Low Priority:
4. **Integration Tests** (#9)
   - Write tests for service initialization
   - Test data flow from backend to UI
   - Add regression tests for Apocrypha

## 9. Service Endpoints Summary

| Service | Status | Real Data | Test Coverage |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Bible | ✅ Active | Yes (except Apocrypha) | Needed |
| Search | ✅ Active | Yes | Needed |
| Library | ✅ Active | Yes | Needed |
| User | ✅ Active | Yes | Needed |
| Sync | ✅ Active | Yes | Needed |
| AI | ✅ Active | Yes (with API key) | Needed |
| LifeSituations | ✅ Active | Yes | Needed |
| Audio | ✅ Active | Yes (with API key) | Needed |
| Analytics | ✅ Active | Yes | Needed |
| Community | ✅ Active | Firebase | Needed |

## 10. Configuration Requirements

To run with full functionality, ensure:

1. **API Keys are set**:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key"
   export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your_key"
   ```

2. **Firebase is configured**:
   - Add `GoogleService-Info.plist` to project

3. **Build Settings**:
   - Ensure `IS_PRODUCTION` flag is set appropriately

## Conclusion

The backend services are properly architected and mostly functional. The main missing piece is Apocrypha support in the Bible services. All services are wired to real data sources and properly initialized through the DIContainer at app launch.
