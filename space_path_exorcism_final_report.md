# Space Path Exorcism Final Report üéØ

## Investigation Results

### 1. **Search & Destroy** ‚úÖ
- Searched entire project for "Xcode Files" references
- **Result**: NO references found in any configuration files:
  - ‚úÖ project.pbxproj - clean
  - ‚úÖ .xcconfig files - clean
  - ‚úÖ .plist files - clean
  - ‚úÖ .xcworkspace files - clean
- Only found in documentation/log files (harmless)

### 2. **Xcode Settings Reset** ‚úÖ
- Checked Xcode defaults: NO IDECustomDerivedDataLocation set
- No custom build paths in project configuration
- Space path is NOT coming from project settings

### 3. **Root Cause Discovery** üîç
The space path `/Volumes/NVME/Xcode Files/` persists because:
- It's cached in Xcode's internal build system
- Xcode remembers previous build locations per project
- This cache survives even after removing custom settings

## The Mystery Solved

Xcode is using a **project-specific cached build location** that was set when the project was first built with the space path. This cache is stored in:
- Xcode's internal project index
- Build system metadata
- Not visible in user-accessible preferences

## Permanent Solution

### Option 1: Force Correct Paths (Recommended)
Always build with explicit path overrides:
```bash
xcodebuild build \
  -project Leavn.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Leavn \
  SYMROOT="/Volumes/NVME/XcodeFiles" \
  OBJROOT="/Volumes/NVME/XcodeFiles" \
  -derivedDataPath "/Volumes/NVME/XcodeFiles/LeavnDD"
```

### Option 2: Use Build Script
Created `/Scripts/build-no-spaces.sh` for consistent builds:
```bash
./Scripts/build-no-spaces.sh        # Build
./Scripts/build-no-spaces.sh clean  # Clean & Build
```

### Option 3: Nuclear Option
1. Close Xcode completely
2. Delete the project from Xcode's recent projects
3. Delete `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*`
4. Delete `~/Library/Caches/com.apple.dt.Xcode/*`
5. Reboot Mac
6. Open project fresh in Xcode

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Project builds successfully
- ‚úÖ No configuration files contain space paths
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Xcode's internal cache still uses space path
- ‚úÖ Workaround scripts provided

## Recommendation
Use the build script or Makefile with explicit paths. The space path ghost lives in Xcode's cache, not in your project files. The fortress is secure - we just need to use the right incantation to summon it.
