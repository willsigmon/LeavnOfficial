# Community & Firebase Removal Summary

## Date: 2025-07-07
## Build Number: 4

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

#### 1. **Removed Community/Firebase References**
- ‚úÖ Removed `community` case from `AppTab` enum in NavigationCoordinator.swift
- ‚úÖ Removed community quick action from HomeView.swift and HomeView_Improved.swift
- ‚úÖ Updated MainTabView.swift to remove default case handling community
- ‚úÖ Community features already disabled in CommunityViewModel (returns empty arrays)
- ‚úÖ Firebase features already conditionally compiled (won't be included without SDK)

#### 2. **Files NOT Removed (Still Present)**
These files exist but are not actively used:
- `/Leavn/GoogleService-Info.plist` - Not referenced in project file
- `/Modules/Community/` directory - Module exists but not shown in UI
- `/Packages/LeavnCore/Sources/LeavnServices/FirebaseService.swift` - Conditionally compiled
- `/Packages/LeavnCore/Sources/LeavnServices/MockCommunityService.swift` - Empty file

#### 3. **UI/Navigation Updates**
- ‚úÖ MainTabView only shows 5 tabs: Home, Bible, Search, Library, Settings
- ‚úÖ No Community tab in navigation
- ‚úÖ Quick actions reduced from 4 to 3 (removed Community)

#### 4. **Build Configuration**
- ‚úÖ Version: 1.0.0
- ‚úÖ Build: 4 (bumped from 3)
- ‚úÖ Created clean build script: `test_build_clean.sh`
- ‚úÖ Created removal script: `remove_community_firebase.sh` (for future use)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

1. **Missing Map Images**
   - Map imagesets exist but only contain placeholder.txt
   - Need actual map images for Biblical locations

2. **Build Verification**
   - Cannot run xcodebuild in current environment
   - User needs to run `test_build_clean.sh` on Mac

### üìã Next Steps

1. **Run Clean Build**
   ```bash
   chmod +x test_build_clean.sh
   ./test_build_clean.sh
   ```

2. **Generate Map Images**
   - Run `create_placeholder_maps.py` or add actual map images

3. **Optional Cleanup**
   - Run `remove_community_firebase.sh` to delete unused files
   - This will permanently remove Community module and Firebase files

4. **TestFlight Submission**
   - Build number updated to 4
   - Ready for TestFlight submission after successful build

### üîß Optional Improvements (Low Priority)

1. **Error Handling**
   - Multiple files use `print("Error: \(error)")` pattern
   - Could be replaced with proper error propagation

2. **Loading States**
   - Most async operations already show loading indicators
   - Some edge cases could be improved

### ‚ú® Summary

The app is now free of active Community/Firebase dependencies. The UI correctly shows only the 5 main tabs, and all Community entry points have been removed or disabled. The build is ready for TestFlight submission once verified on macOS.
