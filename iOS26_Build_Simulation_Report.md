## Conclusion

The Leavn app demonstrates excellent iOS 26 readiness with its modern architecture and proactive feature implementation. The required changes are minimal and primarily involve updating deployment targets and adopting new iOS 26 patterns. The app's use of iOS 26-specific features like Neural Engine integration and Photonic rendering positions it well for the new platform.

### Risk Assessment: **LOW**
- Modern codebase reduces compatibility issues
- No major architectural changes required
- Features gracefully degrade on older iOS versions

### Next Steps:
1. Update Package.swift platform versions
2. Run actual device tests when iOS 26 hardware available
3. Implement remaining Dynamic Island features
4. Submit to TestFlight for iOS 26 beta testing
