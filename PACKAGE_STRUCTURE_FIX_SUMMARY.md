# Package Structure Fix Summary

## Problem
The project had duplicate GUID errors due to conflicting Swift Package Manager configurations.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Disabled Package.swift Files
We've disabled the Swift Package Manager integration by renaming/disabling Package.swift files:

- **`/Packages/LeavnCore/Package.swift`** → Disabled (original saved as Package.swift.disabled)
- **`/Modules/Package.swift`** → Disabled (original saved as Package.swift.disabled)
- **`/Modules/Discover/Package.swift`** → Already disabled

### 2. Created Cache Cleanup Script
Created `clear_xcode_caches.sh` to remove:
- Xcode DerivedData for the Leavn project
- Swift Package Manager caches
- Any .swiftpm, .build directories
- Any Package.resolved files

### 3. Next Steps

1. **Run the cleanup script**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x clear_xcode_caches.sh
   ./clear_xcode_caches.sh
   ```

2. **In Xcode**:
   - Open the Leavn.xcodeproj
   - Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
   - Close and reopen the project
   - Build the project (Cmd+B)

## What This Fixes
- Eliminates duplicate GUID errors
- Treats packages as regular source folders instead of Swift packages
- Removes conflicting package dependencies
- Clears all SPM-related artifacts that might cause conflicts

## Important Notes
- DO NOT re-enable the Package.swift files
- The project now uses direct file references instead of SPM
- All source files remain in their current locations
- No code changes were needed, only package configuration changes
