# Module Dependency Issue Resolution Report

## Issue Summary
The LeavnModules package is unable to import NetworkingKit, PersistenceKit, and DesignSystem from the LeavnCore package, even though these dependencies are correctly declared in Package.swift.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Package Structure**: Both LeavnCore and LeavnModules are local Swift packages correctly structured
2. **Dependency Declaration**: The Package.swift files have correct dependency declarations
3. **Public APIs**: The modules (NetworkingKit, PersistenceKit, DesignSystem) properly export public types
4. **Import Statements**: The source files have correct import statements

The issue appears to be with Xcode's package resolution cache or derived data.

## Actual Module Usage

After analyzing the code, here's what each module actually uses:

### LeavnLibrary
-  Uses NetworkingKit (NetworkService in LibraryAPIClient)
-  Uses PersistenceKit (Storage types in DefaultLibraryRepository)
- L Doesn't use DesignSystem (but declares it as dependency)

### AuthenticationModule  
-  Uses NetworkingKit (NetworkService in AuthAPIClient)
-  Uses PersistenceKit (SecureStorage in DefaultAuthRepository)
-  Uses DesignSystem (UI components in SignInView, AuthFormField)

### LeavnSearch
-  Uses NetworkingKit (NetworkService, Endpoint in DefaultSearchRepository)
- L Doesn't use PersistenceKit (but imports it in DefaultSearchRepository)
-  Uses DesignSystem (SearchView)

### LeavnSettings
- L Doesn't use NetworkingKit
- L Doesn't use PersistenceKit  
- L Doesn't use DesignSystem
- L Doesn't use AnalyticsKit
-  Already fixed by removing unnecessary dependencies

### LeavnBible
-  Uses DesignSystem (BibleView)
- The other dependencies need verification

### LeavnCommunity
-  Uses NetworkingKit
-  Uses DesignSystem

## Solution Steps

### 1. Clean Package Resolution
```bash
# Remove all cached data
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Leavn-*
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/org.swift.swiftpm
rm -rf .build
rm -rf Core/LeavnCore/.build
rm -rf Core/LeavnModules/.build

# Remove resolved files
rm -f Leavn.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/swiftpm/Package.resolved
rm -f Core/LeavnCore/Package.resolved
rm -f Core/LeavnModules/Package.resolved
```

### 2. Fix in Xcode
1. Open Leavn.xcodeproj
2. File ’ Packages ’ Reset Package Caches
3. File ’ Packages ’ Resolve Package Versions
4. Wait for complete resolution
5. Build the project

### 3. Alternative: Command Line Build
If Xcode continues to have issues:
```bash
cd Core/LeavnCore
swift build

cd ../LeavnModules  
swift build
```

### 4. Verify Resolution
Check that in Xcode's Project Navigator:
- Under "Package Dependencies" you see both LeavnCore and LeavnModules
- Each package shows its products (NetworkingKit, PersistenceKit, etc.)
- No error badges on the packages

## Scripts Created

Three diagnostic scripts have been created in the Scripts directory:

1. **fix-package-dependencies.sh** - Basic cleanup and resolution
2. **fix-module-dependencies.sh** - Creates verification file and provides step-by-step instructions
3. **diagnose-and-fix-dependencies.sh** - Comprehensive diagnostic with colored output

Run any of these scripts to help resolve the issues.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Missing required module" errors persist
**Solution**: Ensure Xcode is using the correct derived data location and not a cached version

### Issue: Package resolution seems stuck
**Solution**: Cancel and retry, or use `xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies` from command line

### Issue: Imports work but types aren't found
**Solution**: Check that the types are marked `public` in the source modules

## Verification
After following these steps, the build should succeed. The key indicators:
- No "Missing required module" errors
- All imports resolve correctly
- Types from imported modules are accessible

## Already Completed
-  Removed unnecessary dependencies from LeavnSettings
-  Verified all Package.swift files are correctly structured
-  Confirmed public API availability in NetworkingKit, PersistenceKit, and DesignSystem
-  Created diagnostic scripts to help resolve issues
-  Analyzed actual usage of dependencies in each module
