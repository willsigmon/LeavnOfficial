## To Test Build in Xcode 🛠️

1. **Clean Everything**:
   - Product → Clean Build Folder (⇧⌘K)
   - File → Packages → Reset Package Caches
   - Delete app from device/simulator

2. **Build & Run**:
   - Select iPhone 16 Pro Max simulator
   - Press ⌘R to build and run

3. **Check Console**:
   - Look for "🔄 Starting app initialization..."
   - Should see "🚀 Leavn app initialized successfully"

## If Still Crashing 🚨

Check Xcode console for:
- Specific error messages
- Which thread is crashing
- Stack trace details

The app is configured to:
- Disable CloudKit in DEBUG mode
- Show detailed initialization logs
- Provide fallback for missing services
