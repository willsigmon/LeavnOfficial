# PersistenceKit Duplicate Type Definitions Fix Report

## Issue Summary
The PersistenceKit module had duplicate type definitions across multiple files, causing compilation errors. Types like `Storage`, `SecureStorage`, `FileStorage`, `UserDefaultsStorage`, `KeychainStorage`, and `CacheStorage` were defined in multiple locations.

## Root Cause
The issue occurred because types were duplicated between:
1. `PersistenceKit.swift` - Originally contained all type definitions
2. `Storage.swift` - Had its own definitions of Storage protocol and implementations
3. `SecureStorage.swift` - Had its own SecureStorage protocol and KeychainStorage
4. `CacheStorage.swift` - Had its own CacheStorage implementation

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Restructured PersistenceKit.swift
- Converted it to a module entry point file
- Now only contains shared types like `CacheConfiguration`
- Removed all duplicate protocol and class definitions

### 2. Updated Storage.swift
- Made it the single source of truth for the `Storage` protocol
- Added backward compatibility for deprecated methods (`delete`, `deleteAll`)
- Contains implementations: `InMemoryStorage`, `FileStorage`, `UserDefaultsStorage`

### 3. Updated SecureStorage.swift
- Made it extend the `Storage` protocol properly
- Contains two implementations:
  - `NativeKeychainStorage` - Using native Security framework
  - `KeychainStorage` - Using KeychainAccess library
- Added `saveSecure` and `loadSecure` methods for raw Data storage

### 4. CacheStorage.swift
- Left unchanged as it properly implements the Storage protocol
- References `CacheConfiguration` from PersistenceKit.swift

## Type Organization

### Protocols
- `Storage` - Base protocol (defined in Storage.swift)
- `SecureStorage` - Extends Storage (defined in SecureStorage.swift)

### Implementations
- `InMemoryStorage` - In-memory storage (Storage.swift)
- `FileStorage` - File-based storage (Storage.swift)
- `UserDefaultsStorage` - UserDefaults storage (Storage.swift)
- `CacheStorage` - Memory + disk cache (CacheStorage.swift)
- `NativeKeychainStorage` - Native keychain (SecureStorage.swift)
- `KeychainStorage` - KeychainAccess-based (SecureStorage.swift)

### Supporting Types
- `CacheConfiguration` - Cache settings (PersistenceKit.swift)
- `KeychainError` - Keychain errors (SecureStorage.swift)

## Benefits
1. **No More Duplicates**: Each type is defined exactly once
2. **Clear Separation**: Each file has a specific purpose
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Old methods still work via default implementations
4. **Flexibility**: Two keychain implementations for different needs

## Testing
The fix should resolve all "duplicate type definition" errors. The module can now be imported cleanly without conflicts.
