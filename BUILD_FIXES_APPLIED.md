# Build Fixes Applied

## Date: 2025-07-07

### Fixed Issues:

1. **SyncManager.swift** (Line 20)
   - Issue: `capture of 'self' in a closure that outlives deinit`
   - Fix: Changed `deinit` to call `stopPeriodicSync()` instead of directly canceling the task
   - Added `[weak self]` capture list in the Task closure to avoid retain cycles

2. **HapticManager.swift** (Multiple lines)
   - Issues:
     - Invalid redeclaration of 'selection()' 
     - Cannot find type 'View' in scope
     - Platform compatibility issues
   - Fixes:
     - Added platform checks with `#if canImport(UIKit)`
     - Wrapped all UIKit-specific code in platform conditionals
     - Renamed the `.error` case in `HapticType` enum to `.failure` to avoid naming conflicts
     - Added fallback implementations for non-UIKit platforms

### Files Modified:
- `/Packages/LeavnCore/Sources/LeavnCore/SyncManager.swift`
- `/Packages/LeavnCore/Sources/LeavnCore/HapticManager.swift`

### Next Steps:
1. Run `xcodebuild` to verify the fixes resolved the compilation errors
2. Check for any remaining build issues
3. Continue with integration tasks for the final 20% of the project

### Build Command:
```bash
xcodebuild -scheme "Leavn" -sdk iphonesimulator -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro Max,OS=latest" build
```
